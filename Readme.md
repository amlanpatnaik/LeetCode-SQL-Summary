# LeetCode SQL Summary

**Last updated on August 8, 2021, covered 106 LeetCode SQL questions_**

**WIP**
- Update new SQL questions (Estimated Time: 31 August, 2021)
- Rearrange the repository (Estimated Time: 25 September, 2021 - My Brithday :D)
  1) Only one solution folder will be kept 
  2) Update solution link 
  3) Add Column "Topic" for [LeetCode SQL Questions by ID](#leetcode-sql-questions-by-id)

## Intro

After finishing all 102 LeetCode SQL questions, I feel it could be good to summarize all questions by topics. 

This note aims to **help people _learn and review SQL effeciently_**, espeically when trying to **have a quick catch up on a certain topic**, e.g. complex join, window function, recursive CTE and etc. If you would like to try questions by ID, you could jump to [LeetCode SQL Questions by ID](#leetcode-sql-questions-by-id) where I list all questions coverred in this repository.

And for the first draft, I mainly focus on **_T-SQL/MS SQL Server_**.
